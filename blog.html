            give it to the previous people like many of scammers investment sites. The amount equivalent to 4.8% is not really a heavy profit, and the technical team and elites and the active systems of Buynex can easily afford this monthly profit. The second reason: Buynex is completely against pyramid and network payment system. Of course, paying the referral bonus in a network and pyramid system, encourages people and bring new people to invest in Buynex, well, this is very good and can bring a lot of profit to Buynex, but do you know that payment to pyramid members, payment of commission to the network, to the levels how much of heavy financial obligation does it create for Buynex? Consider this example Alex is introduced to Buynex by (h) and in the pyramid system, several people get commission from Alex's investment. Pay attention to the diagram: In this method, Buynex has to pay , and a different amount of commission and referral bonus, and this is not a good plan at all, it causes corruption, and after a while, the Investment site will also go bankrupt, and And it is called a scam. Buynex does not have any plan to pay to the second and third level and basically, as said, it is against the pyramid payment. Buynex will only give 0.5% referral bonus, but for 12 months In short, Buynex does not have any tempting and seductive offers for us.

      <h2>Reliable or Scam?</h2>
     
we want to talk about this topic what are the differences between reliable and legitimate investment sites and scam sites and how can we determine which site we can trust the most. And you can invest in it and which sites are not reliable. Stay with us until the end of this video. Investment sites that do not have malicious intentions for people's money and intend to continue their activities for a long      <span class="dots">...</span>
      <span class="more">
time ØŒ They have a series of features. First let's check only the technical features. The first feature is to pay attention to the address carefully The site must has S security. In order to have s security, the server hosting company must demand authentication documents from the site owner. Well, of course, this is not enough reason and the owner of the scam site may even give a certificate to the host company to get security. But with care in this issue, at least one site that does not have security will be easily removed. Second: go to the contact page of the site. There should be several ways to communicate with the user, such as online chat, address, phone number, and widely used social networks. Legal website must be present in social networks where most of the people are present and answers people's questions there. Of course, high-level video content is also very important. Reputable companies definitely pay for good advertising content on social networks. Third, that: Check the expiration date of the domain, sites that have a long-term plan, register their domain for five years or ten years. Fourth, that Legitimate websites take great care in having a professional site. Too many spelling, punctuation, and grammar mistakes can mean that the website lacks a technical team and is run by someone who does not care about the content and articles of the site, because it lacks a long-term plan. Occasional typos on a website can happen, but too many mistakes can mean you're not on a legitimate site. Buynex technical issues are at an extremely good level and Buynex support will answer you in the shortest possible time. Buynex will respond to dear users on YouTube, Instagram, Twitter,... and even in some hours of the day and night. Next , we will talk about the differences between the Buynex site and other investment sites from the financial and monetary aspects of investment plans, the amount of interest payments. The differences between legitimate sites and scam and fraudulent sites by examining their fundraising and profit-making plans One of the characteristics of fraudulent investment sites is that they offer different plans to attract your capital. And the benefit of each plan is different from another plan. They give more profit to the plans that we have to pay more money to activate. This is the clearest sign that this site is a scam. Let me explain this issue further. You all have information about paying bank interest to people's deposits in your country. And you are still aware that official state banks in Europe and America and anywhere in the world do not differentiate between the amount of people's capital and pay interest at the same rate to all capitals from a thousand dollars to a billion dollars. Why? Because banks don't have various income earning plans to use people's money in various programs according to their volume. For example, let's say a certain bank in London Since Mr.James's money is 1000 pounds, let's use it in the income project a Because project a gives less profit. Ms.Ashley's money is 20,000 pounds and we have to give her more monthly interest, so we have her money in project b. No, not at all, and banks have the same interest rate for any amount of investment. It is the same way in investment sites. If a site is legal and credible it has only one plan for monthly payment and pays one interest rate.


Because in the world of cryptocurrency and forex and every financial market, you will reach a certain percentage of profit monthly with a strategy and a method. Now, how is it that fraudulent sites have different plans from low to high money and different profits from a few profits to a lot of profit!? for example Bronze plan of paying thousand dollars with daily interest of 3% Silver plan pay $5,000 with a daily interest of 5% Golden payment plan of 10,000 dollars with daily interest of 6% The diamond plan pays $20,000 with a daily profit of 10% do you believe? This is an example of a program to scam you and lure you into choosing a more expensive plan in order to make more money. Any investment site that has different plans to pay monthly interest is definitely a fraud and leave that site immediately. Considering that if the investment site wants to work, credible and legal, it definitely has a strategy with a certain monthly income. According to that fixed monthly income, it cannot pay different interest rates to people. Buynex financial and investment group does not discriminate between investors and all of them give 4.8% profit. Because Buynex's strategy and how to earn money is completely clear, and this financial group earns a maximum of 10% per month and pays an amount equal to 4.8% to the investor and 0.5% as a referral bonus for 12 months. Note that Buynex is the trustee of your money. Buynex wants to grow with an honest operation and with your help, not to add Buynex to the list of scammers

      <h2>How does Buynex benefit us?</h2>
     


where is the source of Buynex's income? How does Buynex benefit us? Definitely, the more transparent this issue is, the source of income, the investor will make a better decision with peace of mind . The transparency of the source of income, the clarity of the ways of capital growth, being aware of the amount of profit and loss of an investment group, can lead to the acquisition of credit for that      <span class="dots">...</span>

 group. I know a lot of investment companies that advertise a lot about interest payment percentages, paying strange referrals to affiliates and so on. They never talk about what exactly they do with people's capital And unfortunately, many of us invest in an unknown site without being asked, and after a while we realize that the site is a scam because they had no plan to develop people's capital. In the continuation of its clarification, Buynex explains to people and investors exactly how it grows people's capital. There are many ways to make a profit in the field of digital currency and forex, and of course all these methods naturally bring losses. Buynex , with a highly specialized team in the field of financial markets, using human experiences and capabilities and using the most powerful software in the field of financial markets, has achieved a strategy based on which the loss of transactions has been reduced to almost zero. Those who are active in the field of digital currency and even have trading experience are well aware of the fact that risk-free trading is impossible unless you pass on a lot of profit and are satisfied with a small profit. For six months before the start of advertising in order to attract capital, Buynex tested its systems and gradually removed the weak points. So that these systems, using the data of Buynex's elite team, are able to bring about half a percent of profit to the group every day. It means something like 9% per month. And as you know, it pays 4.8% to the investor. One percent goes to the marketing team for the referral bonus , a few percent of Buynex costs, including servers, programming team, support team, salaries of employees who often work remotely with Buynex. And finally, a few percent remains as the profit of the Buynex group. This was a summary of Buynex plans for the growth of your money, dear investors

      <h2>How to cooperate with Buynex without capital?</h2>
     


Buynex is the only investment group in the world that respects its colleagues And the people who play a role in introducing investors and develop Buynex and tries to Pay them the most profit. Why?? Because colleagues and marketers have the most effort and work harder than the rest of the team. The reason for this is that Buyex doesn't pay commissions in the form of a pyramid. Paying      <span class="dots">...</span>
      <span class="more">
 commissions in the form of a pyramid and different layers can bring a lot of capital to Buynex, but Buynex never does this , for two reasons. First of all: Paying commissions in a pyramid form to a large number of people requires a lot of money. Buynex, with its strategy for the growth of people's capital and efforts to preserve their capital, does not have astronomical income per month to give a large part of it to the pyramid marketers. Buynex's monthly income is 8% to 9% of the company's total capital. It pays 4.8% to the investor. 0.5 % to referral 4% of expenses and salaries of technical and non-technical personel and profit of the company. Well, let's not neglect our discussion. So far, we have found that Buynex only pays commission and commission equivalent to 0.5% to the first layer and level one. You may ask me that at the beginning of the video you said that Buynex respects colleagues. Now you say that he only pay 0.5%. commission. What kind of respect is this?? Do not hurry You will definitely be surprised to know that you will get that 0.5% for 12 months. Yes, for 12 months, that is, until the end of the contract. For example, you introduced Alex. He made a million dollar deposit on Buynex website. How much is 0.5% of one million dollars?? Tell me soon.. It seems that you are not very good at solving mathematical calculations mentally. Well, I say. It can be 5000 dollars. You will receive this 5000 dollars for 12 months. Well, now go register and get a referral code and plan for a wonderful collaboration with Buynex
